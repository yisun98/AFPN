**Fig.1 caption**: The green and orange layers are spectral and spatial feature maps of spectral and spatial pyramids respectively. Resblock layer contains two convolutional layers, a PReLu activation function, and a residual connection. Upsample layer is Bicubic interpolation and Resample layer is a convolutional layer with stride=2.
